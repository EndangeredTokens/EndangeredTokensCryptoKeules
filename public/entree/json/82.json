{"description": "The collected funds from this collection will serve to incentivize the protection and reproduction of the 'Queule' Endangered Specie of tree. This NFTrunks collection from the Endangered Tokens Kingdom is the first of its kind. As it is inspired in the Endangered Tree species 'Gomortega Keule' it was denominated 'CryptoKeules'. Each one of the 10000 tokens is unique, made from a generative pixel art collaboration with the artist Diegong. 10% of the funds will go directly to the artist wallet, 10% will go a common ReFi fund and 80% of the funds will go to the Endangered Tokens Foundation in order to finance its Preserve-to-Earn ecosystem towards the protection of the Gomortega Keule tree family. The holders of these tokens will be VIP members of our community and will be able to farm rewards when the development is ready.", "external_url": "http://cryptokeule.tokents.org/NFTrunk/1", "image": "http://cryptokeule.tokents.org/NFTrunk/1/CryptoKeule_1.png", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "NFTrunk code", "value": "CK82"}, {"trait_type": "CryptoKeule Code", "value": 82}, {"trait_type": "Background Color", "value": "Light Blue"}, {"trait_type": "Background Elements", "value": "Sun/Clouds"}, {"trait_type": "Soil type", "value": "Grass"}, {"trait_type": "Roots elements", "value": "Roots/Micelium"}, {"trait_type": "Body", "value": "Green Leaves"}, {"trait_type": "Branches", "value": "Yes"}, {"trait_type": "Animal", "value": "Spider"}, {"trait_type": "Liana", "value": "None"}, {"trait_type": "Extras", "value": "None"}, {"trait_type": "Fruit", "value": "None"}], "name": "CryptoKeule #82"}
